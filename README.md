# Graycode
Analysis of Algorithms class assignment
This is an assignment from Analysis of Algorithms class. It prints out the graycode into txt file by giving value of k and n,
where k is base for the graycode (ex. if k = 2, the graycode will only contains 0 and 1, if k = 3, the graycode will contains
0-2) and n as the length of graycode (ex. if n = 2, k = 2, the graycode will be 00, 01, 11, 10).
